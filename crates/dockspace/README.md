# dockspace

`dockspace` is a renderer-neutral docking library for custom editor UIs,
including self-drawn game-engine interfaces. `egui_dockspace` is its interactive
reference adapter. The core owns
docking topology, validated mutations, layout and paint plans, interaction
state, close decisions, persistence identity, and native-surface lifecycle
semantics. Renderers supply measurements, draw the returned plans, report
presentation results, and execute typed platform effects.

The application interface is deliberately item- and surface-centric. Internal
node identities, raw reducer inputs, provider bookkeeping, and backend state
machines remain private. Renderer hosts use the typed `runtime` facade and its
opaque output handles; the raw engine and protocol modules are not a supported
integration surface.

Hosts can consume the ordered surface program immediately or compile it into
owned display lists or retained UI updates. Both use the same output identity
and presentation rules. The independent consumer in
`integration/dockspace-host-harness/` demonstrates this contract using only
public `dockspace` APIs; it does not depend on egui or an OS window.

```rust
use dockspace::model::{
    DockspaceLayout, DockspaceNode, DockspaceRootLayout, DockspaceSurfaceLayout, ItemId,
    RootId, SurfaceId,
};
use dockspace::policy::DockPolicy;
use dockspace::runtime::DockspaceSession;

let item = ItemId::new(1);
let surface = SurfaceId::new(1);
let root = RootId::new(1);
let layout = DockspaceLayout::new([DockspaceSurfaceLayout::new(
    surface,
    DockspaceRootLayout::new(root, DockspaceNode::central_tabs([item])),
)])?;
let session = DockspaceSession::from_layout(layout, DockPolicy::default())?;

assert!(session.view().item(item).is_some());
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## Engine host integration

1. Begin a host frame and supply surface measurements in logical coordinates.
   A surface is a logical layout and input domain; it need not be a platform
   window. Items and roots retain their stable application identities.
2. Obtain a `SurfacePaintPlan` and call `execute_surface_program` to accept its
   complete ordered program into your sink. Copy the required geometry,
   identities, and pane-content references into owned host records if rendering
   will happen after the frame borrow ends. `SourceGap` records preserve semantic
   identity while suppressing ordinary visible source paint.
3. Pass the returned `SurfaceProgramExecutionReceipt` to
   `confirm_surface_painted`, account for unpainted surfaces, then commit the
   frame. A receipt proves complete sink acceptance; the committed
   `PaintedSurfaceOutput` identifies that exact emission. Neither proves renderer
   submission or presentation.
4. After the host knows the final result, consume that output with
   `report_surface_presentation(Presented | Dropped)`. Report `Presented` only
   when the exact output reached the host's presentation boundary. An output
   abandoned by dropping its handle is retired as dropped.
5. Commit a subsequent host frame to accept the ordered presentation prefix.
   Only this successful core commit can grant receiver authority. Use
   `surface_presentation_commits` to promote or retire matching host artifacts,
   and `bind_presented_receiver` to bind current descriptors. Later results may
   arrive first, but cannot bypass an unsettled earlier output in the same
   stream or resurrect an obsolete artifact.

Application commands and prepared surface actions can operate without native
registration. The independent consumer verifies two logical surfaces with the
same coordinate bounds using surface-bound tab actions. Ordered multi-surface
pointer routing and the complete gesture matrix remain separate integration
work; see `docs/VALIDATION.md` for the current evidence and limits.

## Features

- `serde`: session-owned versioned JSON persistence with append-only external
  item identity and viewport placement.

This crate does not own an OS event loop, renderer, widget tree, animation
clock, or platform window. Those responsibilities belong to adapters.
